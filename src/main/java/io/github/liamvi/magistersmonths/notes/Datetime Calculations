Deterministic approach to calculating date-time


Every second it runs, it gets the calendar time (for the 8 hour days)
Sets the world time to the real world time
Want a function that converts

if the hour is below 15, it goes into the 12000 slot (day)
if it's above 15, you go into the 12000+ slot (night)

Java Date class stores an instant of the time with a long count of milliseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00
So we can store the epoch date as the milliseconds at epoch
Then calculate the difference between the epoch and the present time
And multiply the result by 3 to access the current Harptos time

Provisional model -

HarptosDate extending Date, used only for calculation (not sure Date deprecation matters for the project but Cal is better practice).
Calendar:
    - Two options:
        - Handle the formatting for the calendar using a specific formatting class (extending SimpleDateFormat?)
        - Attempt to build an extended class of Calendar (e.g. writing my own "GregorianCalendar" class.)
    - Option #2 is way more effort but might be better practice, will see how it goes - if overly complex with minimal payoff, Op#1.

(JodaTime may be a better library, but trying to stick to factory Java as much as possible for now.)

HPDate & HPCal/Formatting would handle the deterministic calculation of time at 3x speed and the formatting for output.
This would serve as the plugin's ultimate datetime and provide all the information necessary for other functions.
Most critical feature to complete first.

   public String getMonthName(int monthValue) {
        String monthName = "";
        if (monthValue > 0 && monthValue < 13) {
            switch (monthValue) {
                case 1 -> monthName = "Hammer";
                case 2 -> monthName = "Alturiak";
                case 3 -> monthName = "Ches";
                case 4 -> monthName = "Tarsakh";
                case 5 -> monthName = "Mirtul";
                case 6 -> monthName = "Kythorn";
                case 7 -> monthName = "Flamerule";
                case 8 -> monthName = "Eleasis";
                case 9 -> monthName = "Eleint";
                case 10 -> monthName = "Marpenoth";
                case 11 -> monthName = "Uktar";
                case 12 -> monthName = "Nightal";
            }
            return monthName;
        }
        return null;
    }
