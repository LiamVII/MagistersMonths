Leap years - Flamerule 32, Shieldmeet - this seems like a lot of work for little return (4 years is once an IRL year)
Can be done though


Given a day is 8 hours, a festival might fall at like 12:00am on a Monday night. May be best to approach these differently?

375-day year, each festival lasts 24-hours real-time.

DD/MM/YYYY format, simply add a label to each MM.
20:00 - "The 15th of Hammer" - 1491 DR

375 / 3 = 125 IRL days per IG year
2.92 IC years per IRL year

1 day = 8 hours
Need to store the current date every time it increases & on server shutdown
Need to retrieve the current date every time plugin is enabled
Think the Java date class will be too annoying - just create a custom Date class?
